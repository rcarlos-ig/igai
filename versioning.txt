Semantic versioning

First Number: Tracks major changes
Second Number: Tracks minor changes
Third Number: Tracks patches or mere bug fixes
Fourth Number: Tracks changes less significant than a patch


Using the example of consumer software, such as a word processor:

- Increment the major version when you significantly overhaul the user interface, or rewrite all internals. E.g.: “Toolbars use too much screen estate. The UI is now provided through touch gestures only” – such a change would break existing workflows.
- Increment the minor version number when adding a new feature, e.g.: “added support for underlined text”.
- Increment the patch number when you ship a bug fix, e.g.: “fixed bug where application always crashes at 00:00 PM on Tuesdays”.
